Final Project 5/8/19

## Feelings During Finals Week
  This semester was stressful for me, keeping up with projects and exams, while taking 15 credits and working. Most of my finals this semester were project, so I had to use good time management skills to make sure that everything gets done on time. I had one actual exam in one of my classes that was making me very nervous. But I took it on Tuesday and feel pretty good about it. I am so excited to finish up this semester.
